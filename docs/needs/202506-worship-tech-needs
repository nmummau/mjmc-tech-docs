# Worship Tech Needs - June 2025
*From Jeremy*

This is just an update so that you will all know where some of the long term needs stand.

1. The organ speakers are in poor condition (see attached photo), and should be replaced if the organ is to be used long term. I have no idea of the cost, or of the ability to upgrade these speaker boxes without also upgrading the wiring (which is very old and an outdated style, not what would currently be installed).
2. The main projector in the worship center has been on borrowed time for awhile. This past Sunday, we could not get it to turn on -- this used to be a constant problem, but has gone for months without issue. We shut it off at the breaker (backstage breaker box) for about a minute and then switched it back on, and it started up.
    - The unit has two slots for lamps (bulbs) but only one slot works. We found that out when we tried to replace the second lamp but the machine would not recognize there being a lamp in the slot.
    - I consulted with local AV tech companies, and they told me it would have to be taken down and shipped out for diagnosis. We would have to spend $500-1000 just for diagnosis and not know whether it could be repaired. This is why we decided to ride it out for as long as we could, knowing it could fail at any time. But we do have two additional bulbs in the audio closet, which could replace the one that is currently working. It takes a person on an extension ladder to reach the machine, unscrew the hatch, and put the bulb in, so this wouldn't be possible during a service.
    - We have considered replacing the projector (~$10k) or going to an LED wall which would replace the hanging screen (no estimate has been done).
3. The #1 ellipsoidal stage light on the right side of the room does not shut off completely unless the light setting for the room was already one where it was turned off (preset #1 and #7 are like this). If you try to turn off the lights for the room via the switch at the door while the stage lights are on, this light will remain on at a low level. This is not recommended as it will decrease the longevity of the light.
4. Livestream camera #3 in the worship center cuts in and out, and is generally unusable during services. We have been limping by without it. I think it's a cable short, but that takes time to track down and I never got to it. If it turns out to be a camera problem, those units are not under warranty and may cost as much to fix as to replace. Should you decide to buy a new one, you need one with a 30x zoom ability to reach from the back wall to the stage. (We do still have a camcorder on a tripod with a 50' HDMI cable to position it somewhere down front, and that can be used as needed.)
