# Media Checklists

## Mid-week Prep

1. Monitor media team email (mjmc.media@gmail.com) to receive instructions and requests.
1. Within ProPresenter, create sermon slides based on provided preaching notes; Use sermon slide "templates" within ProPresenter.
1. Send sermon slides to preacher for review by Friday. Adjust slides as needed.
1. Within ProPresenter, create a playlist and use the [order of service on Planning Center](https://services.planningcenteronline.com/plans) as a guide to how the worship service will flow.
    - Import songs or media into presentations and edit as needed.
    - Insert song presentations, video presentations, and sermon note slides.
    - Verify slide themes and images for all presentations.
    - Typically Pastor Josh will do this, but you should confirm slides for pre-service slideshow, post-service slideshow, and host announcement highlights are updated within ProPresenter.
