# TODO

- Confirm whether ASA 141 stays as a backup audio feed or can be removed from the live path.
- Verify audio embed settings on the Roland HDMI out and that the Marshall capture sees the correct mix.
- Document the projector-side DTP receiver (model/placement) if present.
- Label the Roland loop-out monitor with make/model once confirmed.
- Note the exact cabling for the Whirlwind DI (RCA in, XLR out) in the equipment page.
- Confirm which Extron device serves the confidence path (currently labeled DSC 301 HD — verify).
- Check whether camera power supplies are on the UPS/Furman chain or on separate mains.
- Identify any intermediate power supplies between the Furman and downstream devices and document them.
