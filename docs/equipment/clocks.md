# Clocks

## Lobby Clock

The remote to this clock is in the Media Closet. It looks like a traditional TV remote.

## Worship Center Clock

The remote to this clock is in the Media Closet. It looks like a car key fob. It's pretty annoying to use but it does work. Usually we only need to set this clock for daylight savings time changes, or if the clock drifts over time.
