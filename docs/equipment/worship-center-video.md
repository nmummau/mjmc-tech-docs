TODO add more info about this

Model: VAC-23SHU3

## Whirlwind IMP 2 Direct Box

TODO finalize purpose and signal route. I think this is the audio from the iMac coming from the scaler.

TODO: finalize purpose and signal route. I think this converts RCA audio from the Roland V-8HD to the iMac used for the live stream audio.

## Extron IN1608

An 8‑input switcher/scaler with DTP outputs. It’s your hub for multiple sources (aux laptop, Blu‑ray, Worship CPU, etc.), scales/ normalizes them, and hands off HDMI/DTP. It can also break out audio and manage EDID/format matching.

## Extron DSC 301 HD

A compact 3‑input scaler. Often used to re‑scale/re‑time the IN1608’s output for a specific display, or to solve EDID/format quirks (e.g., forcing a stable 1080p feed or handling color/HDCP issues) before sending down the line.

## Extron DTP HDMI 230 Tx

The transmitter that converts HDMI to Extron’s DTP (HDBaseT‑like) for a long Cat run to the projector/receiver. This is how the HDMI signal gets over the distance without relying on a long HDMI cable.
